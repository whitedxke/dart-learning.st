Smart Transport.

Description:
You need to create a system that describes different types of transport. 

Use:
- Mixin — to add behaviors (e.g., the ability to fly, swim, etc.);
- Extension — to add extra methods or getters to standard types or your own classes.

Your solution should include:

1. A base class Transport:
It must contain:
- a name field,
- a move() method — can be either abstract or regular, your choice.

2. Mixins:
Create two mixins:
- Flyable — with a fly() method,
- Swimmable — with a swim() method.

3. Extension:
Add an extension:
- For the Transport class — for example, a method describe() that returns a string like: "Transport: Airplane, can fly" (depending on behavior).
- And/or an extension on String, e.g., a capitalize() method → "car".capitalize() // Car.
